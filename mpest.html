		<h1>MPEST / MPRUN</h1>
		<p>
			A parallel version of the code <a href="http://www.pesthomepage.org">PEST</a> (Doherty 2009) called MPEST has been developed to optimize the solving of parallel optimization problems at the LANL multi-processor clusters.
		</p>
		<p>
			MPEST has been applied in many parallel computing projects worldwide.
		</p>
		<p>
			The parallelization in the MPEST framework is performed using the code MPRUN, a code that has been also developed at LANL.
		</p>
		<p>
			MPRUN is using POSIX threads to fork individual model runs to processors; this approach has been demonstrated to be very effective and superior to using MPI calls in terms of computational performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, the parallel subroutines developed for MPEST/MPRUN are imported and further developed in the code <a href="mads.html">MADS</a>.
