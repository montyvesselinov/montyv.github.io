</a>(Kay Birdsell is ;<a href="http://www.ees.lanl.gov/staff/monty/"> Velimir &quot;monty&quot; Vesselinov</a> is PI of the &quot;Flow and Transport Modeling&quot; activities):</p>
<p>LANL is a complex site environmental management.  With over 37   square miles of complex geology and hydrogeology, 2,000 feet of   elevation change, and an average rainfall of less than 12 to 16 inches   per year, it is home to 14 major canyon systems and thus has a large   impact on the Rio Grande.  Ecosystems within the site range from   riparian to high desert and boast over 2,000 archaeological sites, as   well as endangered species habitat.</p>

<p>The complexity and size of LANL operations make   environmental compliance a continuing challenge. Legacy   contamination—both chemical and radioactive—exists at many locations and   is being addressed by remediation efforts under the NMED Consent Order.   Remediation is scheduled for completion in 2015.</p>
<p>  Most of the activities related to in characterizing   groundwater hydrogeology are currently completed and the working to determine the best   possible long-term monitoring network. In the groundwater, we have   found one contaminant, hexavalent chromium, above regulatory levels; and   one, perchlorate, above recommended levels. We are taking actions to   prevent any potential effects on human health and the environment. No   contaminants have been found in drinking water supplies above regulatory   levels. We are working to meet newly imposed surface water effluent   limits.</p>
<p>Systems for risk reduction such as the Environmental   Management System, New Project Review, and pollution prevention are   important to further reduce LANL impacts.</p>
